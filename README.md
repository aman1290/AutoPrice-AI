### 📌 Introduction
AutoPrice‑AI automates the entire vehicle price prediction pipeline—from ingestion to deployment—ensuring reproducible, production-grade ML workflows.

---

### 💼 Business Problem
Accurately predicting used vehicle prices helps dealerships and resellers maximize profits, detect mispriced vehicles, and minimize financial risk by tying price to historical sales and market indicators.

---

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Core**: Python 3.9+, pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow
- **Validation**: Great Expectations or pydantic (for schema)
- **Deployment**: FastAPI / Flask (web inference)
- **Packaging**: Docker
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + pytest
- **Configuration**: YAML, CLI flags, environment variables (via Hydra/config)
